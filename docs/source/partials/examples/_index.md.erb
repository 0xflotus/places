## Simple input

places.js turns any HTML `<input />` into an autocomplete address search bar.

<%= partial '/partials/examples/address_search' %>

```html
<%= partial '/partials/examples/address_search' %>
```

## Complete form

Once the user has selected an address, you can use the [change event](documentation.html#events) to
fill-out another form with the user address structured data.

<%= partial '/partials/examples/address_form' %>

```html
<%= partial '/partials/examples/address_form' %>
```

## Only cities

You can build a city search input by using the [type parameter](documentation.html#options).

<%= partial '/partials/examples/city_search' %>

```html
<%= partial '/partials/examples/city_search' %>
```

FIXME not implemented

## Only countries

You can also search in countries only.

places.js turns any HTML `<input />` into a City as-you-type search bar. You can filter on a specific list of countries if needed:

<%= partial '/partials/examples/country_search' %>

```html
<%= partial '/partials/examples/country_search' %>
```

FIXME not implemented

## Places.js + map

We will use the [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) JavaScript library as an example library to
display the places.js results on the map and update them when needed.

<%= partial '/partials/examples/address_map' %>

```html
<%= partial '/partials/examples/address_map' %>
```

## Mobile search

FIXME what do we want to show here?
