## City Search

Places.js turns any HTML `<input />` into a City as-you-type search bar. You can filter on a specific list of countries if needed:

<%= partial '/partials/examples/city_search' %>

```html
<%= partial '/partials/examples/city_search' %>
```

## Address Search

Places.js turns any HTML `<input />` into an Address as-you-type search bar. You can filter on a specific list of countries if needed:

<%= partial '/partials/examples/address_search' %>

```html
<%= partial '/partials/examples/address_search' %>
```

## Address Form

Places.js turns any complex address `<form />` into a fast and user-friendly as-you-type search:

<%= partial '/partials/examples/address_form' %>

```html
<%= partial '/partials/examples/address_form' %>
```
